"Broadening Accessibility through Special Interests: A New Approach for Software Customization." In _Proceedings of Assets_ _2010_. 2010. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Questions{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} 1.  Tell us about yourself briefly: (a) Your academic background and current research interests; (b) If/how you've been exposed to autism; (c) Why are you taking this course - what do you hope to learn or achieve through it?{{< br >}}2.  Pick a topic from the MRC overview that particularly interests you and tell us briefly why.{{< br >}}3.  Participant observation is the method that was used to understand the issues of discrete trial training in the development of Abaris. What are the opportunities and challenges of being a participant observer in an area like autism? What challenges do you think you'd encounter if you were working directly as the ABA therapist? Speculate on the challenges you might experience during ABA if you were the recipient of the ABA therapy.{{< br >}}4.  Describe briefly how the CareLog and Abaris systems tried to take into consideration design of a solution that respected current work practices and social concerns, especially given that they heavily rely on recorded video that is shared with others. Value of information?{{< br >}}5.  How would you improve Baby Steps to increase the likelihood of adoption and maximum value of information. A lot of screening and diagnosis of developmental delay is based on parent reporting. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| Week 2: Autism Technologies |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Carr, Edward, and Christopher E. Smith. "[Biological Setting Events for Self-Injury](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrdd.1410010204/abstract)." _Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews_ 1, no. 2 (1995): 94-98. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Carr, Edward, et al.

S. Owen-DeSchryver.

Problem behavior can be conceptualized in terms of a four-term contingency. What are the key ideas that underlie this conceptualization?{{< br >}}2.  Many taxonomic categories of biological setting events for problem behavior could be reconceptualized as variants of physiological arousal. Thus, any of the following factors could plausibly alter arousal: medical pain, fatigue, hypersensitivity (e.g., to auditory or tactile stimuli), hyperactivity, anxiety. How might you develop a technology that would allow you to measure and discriminate, in real-time, among the various sources putatively responsible for altering arousal level?{{< br >}}3.  Suppose the technology you developed for measuring arousal level was successful; that is, for a given individual, you were now able to identify arousal "profiles" that appeared to be related, in an orderly and reliable fashion, to a variety of social interaction, educational (i.e., instructional), and biological variables. How might you use these profiles to advise parents, teachers, and doctors about being more effective in living with (parents), educating (teachers), and diagnosing (doctors) people with autism? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| Week 3: Understanding & Treating Problem Behavior in ASD |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Kanner, L. "Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact." _Nervous Child_ 2 (1943): 217-250.

Increasingly, "Kanner autism" is used synonymously with "low-functioning autism" where people have limited or no spoken language and severe social and behavioral challenges. However, others have argued that this label is unfair given the cases Kanner describes in this original paper. Highlight a few items from Kanner's case-study descriptions that support the latter argument.{{< br >}}2.  Herbert's (2005) review paper argues that we need to move away from a "strongly genetic, brain-based model" of autism in favor of a "genetically influenced, systemic model." Describe some of the implications this shift would have on autism research and intervention efforts.{{< br >}}3.  Herbert (2006) likens autism to a "canary in a coal mine." Describe some of the ways that autism can teach us about our modern-day environment.{{< br >}}4.  Briefly describe the "five levels of understanding" of autism that Herbert (2008) suggests can help integrate basic and practical research. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| Week 4: Biomedical & Environmental Factors |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Mottron, L., et al.

ISBN: 9780123705044. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Many autistic individuals write extremely articulate and insightful blogs, and some of these individuals are non-speaking and have difficulty making it through a day without significant help and support. Here are some links to sites prepared by autistic individuals that the course staff has interacted with - and some others they have recommended to us: {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/](http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org](http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://thiswayoflife.org/blog](http://thiswayoflife.org/blog) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com](http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/](http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [http://moggymania.blogspot.com/](http://moggymania.blogspot.com/) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Questions{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} 1.  Mottron, et al. (2006) argue that social brain-based models are too narrow to account for "islets of ability" often demonstrated by both savant and non-savant autistics. Name two ways an enhanced perceptual functioning model can better account for these abilities.{{< br >}}2.  Dawson has criticized the science and ethics of legal and political campaigns to mandate ABA-based autism interventions as "medically necessary" treatment. However, ABA is strongly advocated as "the only method scientifically proven to help autistic children learn." Given your reading of Dawson, et al. (2008), provide at least two arguments you find compelling to support autistic learning outside of ABA.{{< br >}}3.  Some autism researchers describe autistic people as not having a self, and as not being able to reason about the minds of others ("theory of mind"), e.g., "if I were to say that, it would make him unhappy" or "I could see she was upset, even though she didn't say so". Find and quote at least three examples of autistic bloggers showing that they have the ability to reason about the minds of others.{{< br >}}4.  Find and quote: (a) An example of a problem an autistic blogger describes, which sounds just like a problem any non-autistic person would have. (b) An example of a problem an autistic blogger describes, which you think is particular to autism.{{< br >}}5.  Name three ways the characteristics of autism could be used as a strength for employment, hobbies, and leading a fulfilling and productive life. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

Name at least one way that arousal modulation problems can impact a child's development?{{< br >}}2.  What are the characteristics of ASD related to stress?{{< br >}}3.  What factors need to be considered when assessing physiological reactivity in individuals with ASD?

From the Patel and Goodwin readings, come up with two questions: (1) A detail about the papers you'd like clarification on; and (2) A bigger question you have about the findings/work in this area.{{< br >}}2.  Repetitive or stereotypical behaviors are generally defined as being invariant in form and without any obvious eliciting stimulus or adaptive function. However, several of the readings this week suggest that an individual might engage in these behaviors purposely. Describe (1) at least three reasons why an individual might engage in repetitive behaviors; (2) what putative mechanisms are involved; and (3) what evidence there is to support these functions and mechanisms.{{< br >}}3.  Describe a technology you think could be developed to enhance one of the six main topic areas Mirenda (2001) describes in her review, i.e., Assessment, Staff/Family Training, Supports for Augmented Input, Supports for Augmented Input + Output, Supports for Augmented Output, and Assistive Technology for Communication and Learning.{{< br >}}4.
